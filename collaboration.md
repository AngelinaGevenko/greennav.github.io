### Communication

Join us at [our Google community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110704433153909631379)!

We furthermore use this wiki and the issue tracker that are provided by Github. The official email address is greennav@isp.uni-luebeck.de, which is received by the project administrators. You may of course contact any contributor if you have any questions. You are welcome to participate!

### Development

For all Java code we want to stick to the [Google Java Style](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html). For indentation we want to use 4 spaces.

If you want to contribute, then please feel free to fork the repository and create a branch for your development. You can then make a pull request, so that one of the GreenNav organizers can accept your request and integrate it to the project.
