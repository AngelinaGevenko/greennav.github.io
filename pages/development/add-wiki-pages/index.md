## Wiki-Structure

The Wiki you are currently viewing is hosted via github.io. It aims to describe the Greennav project as detailed and structured as possible. In the github.io-repository you will find the pages-folder, that holds a Subfolder for every topic. The subtopics live inside these folders as markdown-files.

## How to add content

If you want to add content, just edit the necessary md-file. The preferred method is to fork Greennav.github.io, add your changes locally and make a pull-request, enabling everyone how also works on the project, to view and to discuss your changes.

If your topic is not yet covered, feel free to add a folder named with your topic inside the pages-directory. Then you can put your md-files in that folder and after your pull-request has been merged, all changes will appear online.
