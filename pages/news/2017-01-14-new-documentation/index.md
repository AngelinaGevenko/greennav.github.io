We are very proud to present our new documentation in a fresh design and a much more responsive way. Because we decided recently to use ReactJS for our project, it was just consequent for our documentation site to switch to a static site generator which is compatible or is even using ReactJS! So from now we are using GatsbyJS.

Because our project is in a very early stage, there are many deprecated parts. So be careful and let us know if anything is not clear! We are always happy, if there is somebody who wants to help us!
