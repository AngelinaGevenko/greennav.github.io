### Wiki-Structure

The Wiki you are currently viewing is hosted via github.io.
It aims to describe the Greennav project as detailed and structured as possible,
leaving out implementation details, since they are generated automatically for
all of our used components.
In the github.io-repository you will find the Wiki-folder, that holds a Subfolder
for every topic. The subtopics live inside these folders as markdown-files.
A polymer-component fetches the wikis content automatically, when the site is viewed.

### How to add content

If you want to add content, just edit the necessary md.-file. The preferred method is
to fork Greennav.github.io, add your changes locally and make a pull-request, enabling
everyone how also works on the project, to view and to discuss your changes.

If your topic is not yet covered, feel free to add a folder named with your topic inside 
the Wiki-directory. Then you can put your md.-files in that folder and after your pull-request
has been merged, all changes will appear online.
