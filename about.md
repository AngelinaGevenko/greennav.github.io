The GreenNav organization is a community of young researchers and students at the University of Lübeck. We decided not long ago to go open source in order to collaborate with others and to show what we are working on.

The projects of the GreenNav organization are closely related to the student projects at the university's computer science program. However, with this organisation we invite everyone to participate in the development of experimental routing systems.

Because the GreenNav organization is not funded, the contributions are mostly done by volunteers. The [project manager](http://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de/staff/schoenfr) is a PhD student researching on routing problems for sustainable transportation and his scholarship is funded by the [Gesellschaft für Energie und Klimaschutz Schleswig Holstein (EKSH)](http://www.eksh.org/). However, most of the work is done by students willing to work on the project during their studies.
